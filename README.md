# You-Tube-Data-Analysis-
I develop Power BI dashboard analyzes YouTube channel performance, providing interactive insights into key metrics like views, subscribers, and video duration. The dashboard allows users to filter data by language, video length, and other dimensions to explore content performance and identify trends.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard's KPI cards provide a high-level view of the analyzed data:

Total Views: 108.21 Billion+

Total Subscribers: 5.45 Billion+

Total Channels Analyzed: 2,280+

Views per Subscriber: 19.86

Views per Minute: 958.14K

Average Video Duration: 17.69 minutes

Dashboard Insights & Visualizations
The interactive dashboard uses a variety of visualizations to answer critical business questions and uncover key trends:

Language-wise Performance: I used a Pie Chart, Tree Map, and Bar Chart to show the breakdown of subscribers, views, and video uploads across multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali). This visualization helps identify which language markets are the most dominant.

Channel Benchmarking: A Scatter Chart was created to analyze the relationship between subscriber count and total views, highlighting top performers like T-Series and Sony Music India.

KPI Tracking: I used KPI Cards to provide a real-time overview of key metrics, such as views per subscriber and average video duration.

Business Questions & Use Cases
This dashboard is a valuable tool for various stakeholders, helping to answer strategic questions and inform decision-making:

Content Creators: Identify the optimal video duration and target language to improve reach and engagement.

Media Companies: Make data-driven decisions on which regional markets to prioritize for content investment.

Analysts & Investors: Track industry trends and identify growth opportunities within the digital content space.

Technical Skills & Learning
This project demonstrates my proficiency in several key areas of business intelligence and data analytics:

Data Modeling: I established effective data relationships to build a robust and flexible data model.

DAX Measures: I wrote custom DAX expressions to create key performance indicators and metrics for the dashboard.

Interactive Design: I used filters, slicers, and a clean layout to create a user-friendly and interactive dashboard experience.

Comparative Analysis: The project focuses on comparing the performance of multi-language content, a crucial skill in global data analysis.

Future Improvements
I plan to enhance this project with the following features:

Integrate engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares to provide a more holistic view of performance.

Add trend analysis to track year-over-year growth for channels and languages.

Incorporate forecasting using predictive analytics to project future views and subscriber growth
